# Robot- 
#Brief :
This task consider a part of building a robot.
We are using H-bridge to control the direction of 2 DC motors, later we can add wheels to the motors and sensors to drive the robot automatically.
the work:
At first we have to identifiy each pin of the H-bridge and its function. So, we can design the circuit digram
Next we have to write Arduino code to change the direction of the motors after specific period.
Later we can insert a sensor and use it to control the directions of the motors.
